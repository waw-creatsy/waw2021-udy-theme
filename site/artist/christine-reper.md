In the beginning there would be Another... In some work, some detail, some marriage of colours,
materials, textures...
Their work or approach draws me in, inspires, joins me on some same emotional level.
Appropriating, experimenting, I let my imagination go to work.
Sometimes along the way, something unforeseen, equilibrium disturbed, an “accident” as I call it.
Encouraging opportunities present themselves. I rush in. I lose myself. I search and examine,
Suddenly here a landscape, there some abstract form or maybe a certain serendipitous geometry.
Presently I am soothed and satisfied by what is appearing on my canvas.
Resolution and harmony translate into inner contentment and perhaps in turn I transmit what someone
else has gifted to me.
