**My painting invites you to dream...** 

The dream of a world where nature is powerful, beautiful, wild, lush, a world of pure beauty preserved from destruction.\
It is one of memories, atmospheres, lights and colors that have moved me in the landscapes of my country and of so many others in the world. I reinvent them to create a universe that suggests a sensory and imaginary journey.
In my painting, I seek a lyrical composition that invites the viewer’s gaze to lose itself in my dreamlike and colorful landscapes, to lose itself in its own dreams … 
For almost ten years I have had the pleasure of passing on my experience, my passion for colour and my research during mixed drawing and techniques courses and training courses on colour.
