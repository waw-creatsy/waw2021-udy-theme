Through nuiits, the anagram of " in situ", we create art installations with collected objects. While taking into account their visual and functional qualities, sometimes totally exalting their past, we divert these objects in order to modify their meaning. By installing them in a place, we give them a new perceptive. Memory, mutation, conversion, lie, creation. We go after the collective and atemporal story through fragments of stories.Â
