The line, the traces, the points, and all marks which punctuate a surface, mark my work since its beginnings. They highlight rhythm, tension and measure.

The lightness and transparency, the superimpositions, the different readings linked, the insertion of various elements, the practice of cutting, are all components of my career.

As early as 1970, by reusing my mother's cutting papers as a support for my drawings, I included the first diversions of objects. The printed lines of his patterns, read through the discreet yellow coloring of the leaf, became the starting point and benchmarks for already imaginary compositions.

The fabrics, the veils, the locally opacified glasses, until the last works on articulated structures, are all elements in reference with privileged moments of my childhood: the contact with the sewing machine of my mother and a cup of blue flannel punctuated with white threads. P.C.
