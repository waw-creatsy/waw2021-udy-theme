serena emiliani (born 1982)



active in the cracks of performance and visual art, the core of the research lies around possible ways to reconnect to different possibilities to create knowledge in a society dominated by a raging technocracy. how do we connect to the world we are visibly and invisibly connected to, how do we create and find symbols stories relations that make sense to us while escaping rationalism and logical truths. 



lives and works between bruxelles and rome.
