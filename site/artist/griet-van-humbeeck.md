Starting from vegetal motives, I want to present vulnerability and transience as a theme and turn it into a kind of beauty experience; a sad lightheartedness. The paintings are created by repeatedly setting up, removing or sanding away the paint. An interaction between the appearance and disappearance of form and color. What remains is a kind of afterimage that makes you muse and invite the viewer to get lost within the uncertain image that is a metaphor for our puny existence.
