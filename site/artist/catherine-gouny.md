My work is a modest reflection on our relationship with animals. Far from the fables of La Fontaine where animals personify our worst faults, these portraits would rather evoke, for me, a mythical golden age, nestled in a more or less distant past in which our industrious intelligence would not yet have separated us from the other occupants of planet Earth. Hence the deliberately backward-looking aspect of my paintings: chalky and weathered material like an old wall, dark backgrounds, golden framesâ€¦ .. from this imaginary past these non-humans, dressed like princes look at us and question us.
