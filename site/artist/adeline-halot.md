Adeline Halot creates hand-woven metal sculptures. Pieces that come to life in space, within an architecture. Each of her creations is a desire to translate natural elements - minerals and plants - into woven pieces. 

The combination of natural fibres and metal reveals a dynamic result. As light passes through and reflects upon it, the material becomes alive. 

Adeline Halot brings a new dimension to the practice of weaving, overturning its codes for new and surprising results.  Her precise creations are the result of an instinctive expression where randomness takes a determining place and organises the material. 

Matter and form are given pride of place. Elements which live with a person and participate in time.
