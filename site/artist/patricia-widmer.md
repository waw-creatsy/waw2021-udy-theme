Curious by nature, I have always loved creating and working with my hands. I have always loved exploring, playing and marveling. I found all this in ceramics.

My Bubbles come in different sizes, different colours, with or without dots, but they are always round, round like the earth, the moon, round like soap bubbles...

Each Bubble is unique and wonderful, like each and every one of us.  By its roundness and simplicity it invites to softness and reverie.

Nature is my main source of inspiration, its beauty, its strength, its softness, its intelligence guide me on my way. I love to go for a walk, to sit at the foot of a tree and contemplate the trees, the sky and the clouds. Then I go to work. When I work with clay, I don't think, my hands work by themselves and Bubbles are born under my fingers. 

Through my creations, I hope to offer people a break from the hustle and bustle of life. When you look at my bubbles, it is an invitation to rest, to dream.  The technique of terra sigillata gives a satin aspect which is a call to caress, to softness, to touch and be touched.

I don't name my works  so that people can project themselves into them more easily, so that they can better feel how they interact with them, and leave their imagination run, so that they are not influenced by a title and can name them as they wish.
