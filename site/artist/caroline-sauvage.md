This is what prevails, as much in the beginnings as in the progressive development of my research: If everything is connected, and knowing that I cannot abstract myself from the process, I can nevertheless render myself discreet enough to hear the memories of my original material. This is what pushes me to glean these remains of nature as the starting point of a project. Dried hulls, dead wood or animal remains, these "objects" are traces of the living, each with their own memory. Fragments of which escape them. From the first glance, my story will interweave with theirs, invariably.

However, I still have in mind to try to erase myself to enhance these languages ​​and discrete signs that each material renders.



Over the course of research / work, a few recurring leads emerge.

The attraction to the fragile, the tenuous, the vulnerable. Which hangs by a thread.
