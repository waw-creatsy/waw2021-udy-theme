«Body & Wood» is a series of photo works. My creative approach is to rework the photos, recolour them, redraw them and then merge them into a completely different universe. My objective is to surprise the spectator even to disturb him. Each creation is original and unique. Once the work printed, the digital file is destroyed. Each work is accompanied by a certificate of authenticity.
