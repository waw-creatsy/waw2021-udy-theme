« The wood exhibits are shaped through their carbonization, fire being used here as a tool. Contrary to the symbol of destruction with which it is commonly associated, fire is a tool like any other for the extraction of materials, for carving a hollow, or for creating a void.  Like graphite, fire modifies form and matter, in this case with a single flame jet. Under the force of the heat, wood fibres undergo changes in colour and apearance. While wood is perceived as an element derived from nature and close to life, charred wood belongs to a totally different category. It is the product of a mutation that puts a stop to any ulterior transformation, fixing it in an unchangeable state. Charred wood achieves a new equilibrium far removed from its original vegetal state. »
