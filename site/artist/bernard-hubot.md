“ Those who visit - how to say? His house, his workshop, his garden (the garden has entered the house - the workshop would be the place where this is brought into play: the garden in the house - and therefore: the little animals which continue their life in the notebooks , notebooks-houses, notebooks-burrows, notebooks compost…) Those who visit, let's say the creation and the place of the creation; but let us say the process of creation, those who visit are inside it, put into the creation itself, as if put on stage. Eventually, what is happening around them will transcend them and they will soon start playing. It seems that for Bernard, what he does may be as much the product of the one who comes than what he produces himself. He has produced it but what surrounds him is also the product of those who come to take a look. The visits. We are overwhelmed by what is happening around us, we can feel it, it is happening. We take part in this voyage: we comment, we touch, we move, we also do. It’s not so much Bernard’s place anymore, it’s the place of doing - yes it is! - but his home is where others come to visit, and what do they do? They just do, it happens. Bernard does with them ... With what they do ....”
