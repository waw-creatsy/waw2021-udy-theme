We find in the sculpture of Catherine Thiry, all the influence of her painting.

She models the clay with large strokes, as a painter would apply paint to canvas.

A unique technique, which brings a particular force to his works, which bronze and iron magnify. We feel the moment of creation in each imprint. Quick gestures that literally bring the  matter to life.

Through the vibrant form,  the thrilling surfaces, it is the energy that presides.
