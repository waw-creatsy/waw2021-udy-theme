"Reality bores me, I need fiction"

To take lifeless matter and to reveal its movement, to unhinge reality, to rethink space, to provoke a
distance, to make room for playfully suspended time....
To shift certitudes to elsewhere, into a space that frees itself from its rationality, where time and natural
references fade away and open up to new vintage points....
In a previous approach I used black light as my matter, it underscored the vibratory motion, chased its
lightness into being.
More recently I have explored other ways and matters to embody kinematic movement.
