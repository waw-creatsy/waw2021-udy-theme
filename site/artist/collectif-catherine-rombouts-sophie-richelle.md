On February 9, 2015, she celebrated her 80th birthday.

She danced again, she laughed again.

On February 13, 2015, she left. She had decided.

She suffered from a serious pathology.

Catherine Rombouts is a photographer, Christiane was his mother. Sophie Richelle is a historian.

We tell in a book, in images and in texts, the end of Christiane's life. In Belgium, euthanasia has been permitted within the strict framework of the law since 2002. This book offers an overview of the realities that it covers. For Christiane and others, the possibility of this choice allowed for a more dignified death, in keeping with their definition of life.

We would like this book, through this beautiful and singular story, to fuel the debate in countries where this question divides.
