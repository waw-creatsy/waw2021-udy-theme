After a childhood in Africa, whence she drew her love of nature and freedom, Brigitte Schùermans received a classical education, both musical and pictorial.



Her oeuvre of both drawings and paintings celebrates the splendours and storms of the flesh and the heart, but also the dazzling complexity of nature as revealed by the advances of contemporary science.  



Schùermans explores digital creation, combining her academic training with the potential of technological progress. Working on a tablet and using powerful computing programs, she creates effects and nuances of both form and colour that traditional painting could not achieve, which open up new avenues to her artistic sensitivity, enabling her to depict facets of reality previously unexplored by the plastic arts. 



Her work thus connects with the highly innovative creations of contemporary classical music composers such as Jean-Pierre Deleuze, Annette Vande Gorne, Jaime Reis, or even of a poet such as Miguel Mesquita da Cunha, whose art inspirse her and which in turns she illustrates.
