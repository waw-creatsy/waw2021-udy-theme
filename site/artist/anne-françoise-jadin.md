During the pandemic and ensuing lock-downs, my work « shrunk ». My artwork went from extra-large to small, mirroring the changes in our day-to-day lives. Here I present these mini-creations.



Watercolors on arch paper (?), fragments of paintings by Ingres, Vermeer, and Rodin (Rodin’s erotic watercolors).



Forbidden travels now occur on the backs of turtles, snails, slugs, or at best bulls.

The fly returns with Spring, as cows return to the pasture.



I work in 3D… faces as pebbles with masks covering… eyes.



As usual, I let my imagination precede conscious thought: thinking is triggered by the result. “Art is emotion without desire” (translated from L’élégance du Hérisson).
