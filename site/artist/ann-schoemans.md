Pieces of wood, seaweed collected in Ireland,two screws, two metal washers, observation,…

What are the ears of a bull like?

She sands, she planes, she nails, she glues, she assembles, she spends hours doing that!

And there he is,a bull, very small, moving,welcomed as one would with a newborn.

Oh,how beautiful he is!And those horns!

He is robust, he looks tender.A tender bull!

He appears suddenly from her hands and it’s as if her own heart begins to beat within him.

Who said that only beings of flesh and bones are alive?



Cécile Mertens
