Antoine De Schuyter's audiovisual installation work combines sculpture, projection and sound creation.

He works most of the time in situ and therefore, the materialization of his works depends on the situation and the environment of it.

Antoine De Schuyter's installations are based on contemplation and the sensation of immersion, projecting the viewer into the observation of the development of an abstract entity through light, matter, perspective and sound.

Overlays of images projected on different textures and variations in viewpoints on the viewer will be subjected to blur the sensations and give the impression of looking at an abstract entity in constant evolution.
