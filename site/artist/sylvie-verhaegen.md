<!--StartFragment-->

The artistic creation is for me a special way to traduce concretely a look on a reality, a reflection on a personal and collective lived history.

The clothes I am wearing, the place I am living, the nature that surrounds me.

 To observe, to keep track of this connection to life in perpetual transformation:

Creation – destruction – rebirth.

The human madness shows herself in the white shroud covering the sacrificed city.

An abandoned dress reminds us the contours of a disappeared body.

A grove of trees is resisting. The canopy connecting the earth to the sky, opens a path where shadows and light play an elusive music score.
