Born in 1996 in Belgium, I am currently pursuing an education as an author-illustrator at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels. My work focused on picture books, I draw, write stories and design the album entirely. I also produce a more pictorial work, which mostly involves engraving and painting. 
Since my work is mainly constructed around books, the images I create tell stories. Often, my projects’ subjects are built around the call of discovery, travel and motion, but also territory and cohabitation between nature and the human world. I imagine and compose illustrations that take place in specific locations in which characters evolve. Landscapes play an essential part in my compositions. I have a great interest in the atmospheres that areas can give out. I add details and hints, which guide the readers throughout the narration. 
Observation is at the center of my work. I carry many sketchbooks when I travel, they allow me to capture some pieces of everyday life. Observation also requires attention to little surprising things, that’s where the stories begin.
