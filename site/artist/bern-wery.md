There are two notions of speed in painting. Speed of conception and speed of execution. The mind and the body. Bern Wery reconciles the two. His compositions incorporate a ferment of speed evoking a sense of franic motivation. He dreams of overtaking time itself. A notion which can only be illusory. Although the effects are very real. Captured between two fleeting seconds, between the blinks of an eye, a picture of blue en gold penetrates the canvas and shows itself as if for a photograph. The eye adapts. The word stands still. Once again the painting has just created itself. We are on the seventh day. Bern Wery lays down his brush. Luc Delisse, Le mouvement de l'oeil, 1988
