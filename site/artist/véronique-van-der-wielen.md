Through the portraits "Eye to eye"

, she take the time to look at the
person in front of her. Everything simply stems from two gazes that
cross paths. Maintaining eye contact, She draw continuously one
portrait after the other. In black and white, the line is uninterrupted. In
colour, I grab the tools at hand to draw "what is". More than an artistic
piece, it is a profoundly humane experience, an opportunity to let
yourself be seen, to look differently, to meet one another. It's also a
collaboration between Art and Gaze, between Line and Portrait, a
weaving of genuine connections between oneself and the other.
Every line, every portrait, every word has it's "raison d'être"/purpose.
They mirror a form of accuracy, of truth, of authenticity. After having
drawn "Eye to Eye" of over 900 people from here and there, she can
witness through her drawings the mystery, the softness and the
intensity of these shared moments.
