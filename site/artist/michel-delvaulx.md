Michel Delvaulx immerses us in an imaginary world of wonder and admiration giving homage to both objects and beings.
Each of his visual creations evokes the idea of an imagined parallel dream-like world with its singular beauty, inspired by an
impish creative liberty.
Forming a marriage between the strange & the familiar to re-inspire and challenge people in their everyday lives.
Graphic art & photography form the basis of Michel Delvaulxâ€™s work using creative imaging software on his iPad Pro with the
results being printed meticulously onto high quality paper.
